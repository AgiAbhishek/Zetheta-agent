Dhoni (born July 8, 1982, Ranchi, Gujarat  state, India) is an Indian cricketer whose \nrise to prominence in the early 21st century culminated in his captaincy of the Indian \nnational team that won the one-day Cricket World Cup in 2011. \nDhoni made his international debut in 2004. His talent with the bat came to the fore in \nan innings of 148 runs against Pakistan in his ﬁfth international match. Within a year he \njoined the India Test team, where he quickly established himself with a century (100 or \nmore runs in a single innings) against Pakistan. Despite his inexperience, Dhoni took \nover the captaincy of the one-day side in 2007 and led India to the Twenty20 (T20) world \ntitle. Series wins over Australia and Sri Lanka, among others, moved India to the top of \nthe International Cricket Council (ICC) Test rankings for the ﬁrst time in December 2009. \nDhoni was honoured for his play with the ICC One Day International Player of the Year",
